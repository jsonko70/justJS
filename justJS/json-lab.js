/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *	 Less than fulfilling wasn't it. The greatest movie ever and all we get is
 *	     Object {title: "Casablanca", originalTitle: "", year: "1942", releaseDate: "19430123", directors: Array(1), â€¦}
 *		 But what did we see?
 *	         We can see some of the individual attributes of the object
 *	         when the member contains an Object, the Object does not get 'unwound' 
 *           and 'Object' is displayed
 *	         but you can open it in debug and expand the inner layers
 *           But we have a start. If you need the title you can use the variable
 *           followed by the attribute movie.title
 *           some of the attributes are arrays
 *           movie.genres is an array of the genres War, Dramma, Romance
 *           movie.actors is an array of JSON objects each one is another set of data
